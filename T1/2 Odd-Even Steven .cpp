/*

Steven is trying a new operation over a string. The operation is that he will merge all the same 
consecutive characters in a string e.g if a string is aabb , he will convert it to ab .

Now, after doing this for a lot of strings, Steven observed an interesting thing that some of the strings
became a palindrome. He gave these palindromic strings and the original string to his son.

His son then asked him a difficult question, that how many palindromic sub-strings of even length and odd length
could be formed fromed from the original string before and after merging operation. 


Input Specs : The String (input string is made up of characters 'a' and 'b' .

Output Specs : A 2 element array with the first element as the number of even length sun-strings and the second element as the number of odd length sub-strings.

Eg :

Input : aabb
Output : {2,4}
